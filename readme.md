# VIRTUAL ASSISTANCE

### About

This is a virtual Assistance that is developed in C++. This project provides a digital infrastructure that supports the user to make life ease. It benefits those in need of tech support. It takes commands by texting and assists in the text and voice.

I have used **eSpeak** in my project which is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English and other languages, for Linux and Windows. It is text-to-speech software.
